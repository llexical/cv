        Full stack engineer with 10+ years of experience, currently working as Principal Engineer.
        I am passionate about solutions that benefit the whole team. I believe strongly in engineers having product involvement and the interest to help them make the best technical decisions for the business as a whole.
        I combine strong technical knowledge with proven architectural skills. I am always looking for my next challenge with new languages, ideas or processes.

                In 9 years at Hubble, I grew from a Product Engineer to a Principal Engineer. I have deepened my knowledge across the full stack, learning to work effectively in a fast-paced environment,
                while building team consensus around technical decisions and ensuring I work towards continuous personal development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have led technical projects, mentored coworkers and been instrumental in architecting and delivering solutions to address various technical challenges across the platform.
                Recently I have led the architectural design for a solution to handle imports from multiple different external data sources to manage our inventory, reducing the time to add new host imports from a few weeks to just a few days.
                As Principal Engineer I have enabled the team to consistently work on important ops updates and maintenance without delaying feature delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                For most of my time at Hubble I have been working with a tech team of 4-10 developers and at times across multiple teams.
                I regularly code across our stack, working to improve our current infrastructure, picking up tickets and developing new features.

              <p>Cohaesus is a tech partner to leading digital agencies and I worked as a developer for numerous agencies in London, such as VML, Holler, and VCCP. My work here ranged from front-end Javascript frameworks such as Angular, Backbone and React, to server side projects using Node.js and PHP. While I was here I worked with different clients on site, and I quickly picked up how to work as part of different development teams.
