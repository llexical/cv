# Lizzie Davison - CV
A fun little project written using Eleventy to host my CV. Never used it before but honestly surprisingly nice and simple.

## Requirements
- Node v24.2.0 (just use `nvm use` if you have it)

## Setup
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Build
Before commiting it needs building, these built static files can then be deployed,
- `npm run build`
